			<h1 class = "1">Origin</h1>
				<p>The origin of drones dates back to the early 20th century, initially designed for military purposes. However, drones have </p>
				now become an integral part of our daily lives, impacting various aspects with advancements in technology,drones have</p>		
				transitioned from military reconnaissance to tools widely used in photography, videography, and social media content creation.</p>
				They have also found applications in package delivery, revolutionizing the way goods are transported. In agriculture, drones </p>
				assist in monitoring crops and optimizing farming practices. Additionally, drones play a vital role in search and rescue operations,</p>
				reaching inaccessible areas and aiding emergency responders. The recreational use of drones has also surged, attracting </p>
				hobbyists and enthusiasts. However, concerns over safety, privacy, and regulation have prompted the establishment </p>
				of guidelines to ensure responsible drone use.  Overall, drones have significantly influenced our daily lives, </p> 
				providing new possibilities and improving efficiency in various industries. </p>

			<h1 class = "2">Purpose </h1>
				<p>The purpose of drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), is multifaceted. Drones are designed to perform tasks that</p>
				are either too dangerous or impractical for humans to undertake. They serve a wide range of purposes, including military </p>
				reconnaissance, surveillance, and combat missions. Drones are also used in civilian applications such as aerial photography </p>
				and videography, package delivery, agriculture, infrastructure inspection, search and rescue operations, environmental </p> 
				monitoring, and scientific research. By providing aerial perspectives, collecting data, and executing tasks with precision, </p> 
				drones enhance efficiency, safety, and convenience in various fields, making them invaluable tools in our modern world. </p>
